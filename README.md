# Overview

In this program I explored a little about animation and what I can do with animation. I looked at a few different python libraries that I could use and found that mathplotlib was one of the easiest to use.

# Development Environment

My sophwere was all build in visual studio code using python as the language. I mostly used matplotlib as the library to get animation and graphs to show up.
